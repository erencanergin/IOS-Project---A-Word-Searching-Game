# IOS-Project---A-Word-Searching-Game
It's a project that I made during the course I took, IOS Programming

"Word Search" is an IOS application that allows users to play in a 5x5 board to find specific words in a
specific time.

Functions:

	-> The game is played on a 5x5 grid.
	
	-> There is a tips label that shows the words that can be found.
	
	-> When a correct word is found, It'll be deleted from the tips.
	
	-> When user finds a incorrect word, path of incorrect word will be deleted from screen.
	
	-> Users can move up, down, left, right and diagonal directions.
	
	-> Every new start, the board comes with a new matrice.
	
	-> Words are taken from Turkish Language Instution(TDK).
